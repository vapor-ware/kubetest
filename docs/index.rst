kubetest
========

``kubetest`` is a `pytest <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/>`_ plugin that
makes it easier to write integration tests on Kubernetes. This allows you to
automate tests for your Kubernetes infrastructure, networking, and disaster recovery.

kubetest was written out of a desire to test deployment behavior in a
quasi-deterministic manner. Other solutions exist for on-cluster testing, such
as `chaos testing <https://principlesofchaos.org/>`_, but often those solutions
lack the ability to test the specific state of a small piece of the deployment.

kubetest aims to make that easier, giving you control of your cluster from within
your test cases, and providing a simple API for managing the cluster and the objects
on it.

Features
--------

- Simple API for common cluster interactions.
- Uses the `Kubernetes Python client <https://github.com/kubernetes-client/python>`_ as
  the backend, allowing more complex cluster control for actions not covered by our API.
- Load Kubernetes manifest YAMLs into their Kubernetes models.
- Each test is run in its own namespace and the namespace is created and
  deleted automatically.
- Detailed logging to help debug error cases.
- Wait functions for object readiness, deletion, and test conditions.
- Allows you to search container logs for expected log output.
- RBAC permissions can be set at a test-case granularity using pytest markers.


.. _installation:

Installation
------------

kubetest can be installed with ``pip``

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pip install kubetest


.. note::
   The kubetest package has entrypoint hooks defined in ``setup.py`` which allow it to be
   automatically made available to pytest. This means that it will run whenever pytest is run.
   Since kubetest expects a cluster to be set up and to be given configuration for that
   cluster, pytest will fail if those are not present. It is therefore recommended to only
   install kubetest in a virtual environment or other managed environment, such as a CI
   pipeline, where you can assure that cluster access and configuration are available.
